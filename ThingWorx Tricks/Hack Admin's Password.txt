If we know any existed user/password, then we can add that user into Administrators in Database, and then restart Thingworx.
After that, we can use that user to get login as admin, and then change password of user Administrators.
For example, after installation of Analytics extension, we have a new user AnalysisUser with password of "test".
Then we can run below PostgreSql to add it into admin group:
-------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE "group_model"
SET "member" = '[{"name":"Administrators","type":"Group"},{"name":"Administrators","type":"User"},{"name":"AnalysisUser","type":"User"}]'
WHERE "name" = 'Administrators';
-------------------------------------------------------------
